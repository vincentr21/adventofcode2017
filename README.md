# Advent of Code 2017

Advent of Code is all about speed -- how to get the correct answer in the shortest amount of time by translating your brain's neural activity into machine code. As such, most solutions are quick and dirty and unlikely to be optimal.

## Notes

### Day 1
story of day1:  
part1 - ok iâ€™m gonna be cheap and not use/think about modulus math  
part2 - fk I need modulus math (or not)

### Day 2
part1 - simple array min and max  
part2 - O(N^2) brute force search for divisor

### Day 3
part1 - pen and paper, if `n^2` is a perfect square, then the steps to `n^2` from `1` is simply `n-1`, then count backwards to where you need to be  
part2 - some spiral array traversal, storing positions of elements as key in a hash
